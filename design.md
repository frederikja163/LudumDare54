### Further brainstorming on two favorites

City builder

- Square marching for digging out caves
- Several layers of buildings
- A building may take up several layers, for example a staircase
- Building types:
  - Food chambers
  - Farms
  - Queens chamber
  - Pupae chamber
  - Graveyard
  - Training grounds
- Ant upgrades
- Ant types
  - builders
  - farmers
  - workers
  - soldiers
  - queen
- Requires ant combat power to defend the anthill
- Random events
  - Predators (human children)
  - water dammage
  - winter (less food)

Ant war

- Borrow many of the concepts from the city builder
- Escape from an ant farm, or battle against another anthill
- Send some ants out for gathering ressources
- Send others out to fight or escape from the antfarm
